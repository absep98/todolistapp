Certainly! Adding authentication brings in more complexity, but we can still achieve it with a structured timeline over 3-4 weeks if you’re working for 30-45 minutes daily. Here’s a detailed breakdown including authentication, task management, and optional features.

---

### **Week 1: Backend Setup with Authentication and CRUD API Development**

- **Day 1**: **Project Initialization**
   - Set up the project folders (server and client) and initialize with `npm init` for the backend.
   - Install dependencies like `express`, `mongoose`, `bcrypt`, and `jsonwebtoken` for user authentication, along with `nodemon` for development.

- **Day 2-3**: **MongoDB Setup and User Schema**
   - Set up MongoDB with Mongoose and design the `User` schema with fields for username, email, and hashed password.
   - Add a `Task` schema (e.g., title, description, status, category, timestamps) with a reference to `User`.

- **Day 4-6**: **User Authentication API**
   - Create routes for `sign-up`, `log-in`, and `log-out`:
      - **Sign-Up**: Save the user with a hashed password using `bcrypt`.
      - **Log-In**: Validate credentials, generate a JWT token, and send it as a response.
      - **Log-Out**: Handle log-out by clearing the token on the frontend.
   - Store JWT tokens to manage sessions.

- **Day 7**: **Testing Authentication API**
   - Use Postman to test `sign-up`, `log-in`, and `log-out` routes and ensure token-based authentication is working.

### **Week 2: Task Management API and Basic Frontend Setup**

- **Day 8-10**: **Task CRUD API with Express**
   - Create protected routes for task operations (only accessible if logged in):
      - **Create**: Add a new task with the authenticated user’s ID.
      - **Read**: Retrieve tasks belonging to the logged-in user.
      - **Update**: Edit a task’s details.
      - **Delete**: Remove a task from the user’s list.
   - Use JWT for route protection by verifying tokens.

- **Day 11-12**: **React Setup and User Authentication UI**
   - Set up the basic React app structure in the `client` folder with `create-react-app`.
   - Install `axios` for making API requests.
   - Create simple forms and pages for **sign-up** and **log-in** and connect them with the backend.

- **Day 13-14**: **Session Management in React**
   - Store the JWT in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` after login.
   - Set up React context or state management to store user session data.
   - Implement `log-out` by clearing the token and session data on the frontend.

### **Week 3: Task Management UI and Advanced Features**

- **Day 15-17**: **To-Do List UI in React**
   - Create components for viewing the task list, adding new tasks, and displaying task details.
   - Fetch tasks from the backend for the logged-in user and display them in a list.

- **Day 18-19**: **CRUD Operations in the UI**
   - Implement the ability to **add**, **edit**, and **delete** tasks.
   - Update the UI in real-time after each CRUD operation, ensuring the backend changes are reflected.

- **Day 20-21**: **Task Categorization (Optional)**
   - Add functionality to categorize tasks (e.g., “personal” or “work”).
   - Allow users to filter or view tasks by category.

---

### **Week 4: Polish, Error Handling, and Testing**

- **Day 22-23**: **Error Handling and Validation**
   - Add error handling to display messages (e.g., invalid login credentials).
   - Validate inputs both on the client side and the server side.

- **Day 24-25**: **Styling and UI Improvements**
   - Add basic styling using CSS or a UI framework like Bootstrap or Material-UI to improve the look of the app.

- **Day 26**: **Final Testing and Bug Fixing**
   - Test all functionalities thoroughly to make sure everything works as expected.
   - Fix any bugs, clean up code, and organize files for a more professional structure.
